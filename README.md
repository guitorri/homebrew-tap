homebrew-tap
============

Personal formulae for the Homebrew package manager  http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew

Here you can find stuff that I am either testing or too lazy to submit to Homebrew.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------

Just `brew tap guitorri/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install guitorri/tap/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

    brew install https://raw.github.com/guitorri/homebrew-tap/master/<formula>.rb
